title: Usage
---

```js
import { createRegExp, exactly } from 'magic-regexp'

const regExp = createRegExp(exactly('foo/test.js').after('bar/'))
console.log(regExp)

// /(?<=bar\/)foo\/test\.js/
```

## createRegExp

Every pattern you create with the library should be wrapped in `createRegExp`, which enables the build-time transform.

The first argument is either a string to match exactly, or an input pattern built up using helpers from `magic-regexp`. It also takes a second argument, which is an array of flags or flags string.

```js
import { createRegExp, global, multiline, exactly } from 'magic-regexp'

createRegExp(exactly('foo').or('bar'))

createRegExp('string-to-match', [global, multiline])
// you can also pass flags directly as strings or Sets
createRegExp('string-to-match', ['g', 'm'])
```

::alert
By default, all helpers from `magic-regexp` assume that input that is passed should be escaped - so no special RegExp characters apply. So `createRegExp('foo?\d')` will not match `food3` but only `foo?\d` exactly.

## Creating inputs

There are a range of helpers that can be used to activate pattern matching, and they can be chained. Each one of these returns an object of type `Input` that can be passed directly to `new RegExp`, `createRegExp`, to another helper or chained to produce more complex patterns.

| `char`, `word`, `wordChar`, `wordBoundary`, `digit`, `whitespace`, `letter`, `tab`, `linefeed` and `carriageReturn` | these are helpers for specific RegExp characters.                                                                                                                   |

## Chaining inputs

All of the helpers above return an object of type `Input` that can be chained with the following helpers:

|                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `and`                                         | this adds a new pattern to the current input, or you can use `and.referenceTo(groupName)` to adds a new pattern referencing to a named group.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `or`                                          | this provides an alternative to the current input.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `after`, `before`, `notAfter` and `notBefore` | these activate positive/negative lookahead/lookbehinds. Make sure to check [browser support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp#browser_compatibility) as not all browsers support lookbehinds (notably Safari).                                    |
| `times`                                       | this is a function you can call directly to repeat the previous pattern an exact number of times, or you can use `times.between(min, max)` to specify a range, `times.atLeast(num)` to indicate it must repeat x times or `times.any()` to indicate it can repeatÂ any number of times, _including none_. |
| `optionally`                                  | this is a function you can call to mark the current input as optional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `as`                                          | alias for `groupedAs`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `groupedAs`                                   | this defines the entire input so far as a named capture group. You will get type safety when using the resulting RegExp with `String.match()`.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `grouped`                                     | this defines the entire input so far as an anonymous group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `at`                                          | this allows you to match beginning/ends of lines with `at.lineStart()` and `at.lineEnd()`.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

::alert
By default, for better regex performance, creation input helpers such as `anyOf`, `maybe`, `oneOrMore`, and chaining input helpers such as `or`, `times(.between/atLeast/any)`, or `optionally` will wrap the input in a non-capturing group with `(?:)`. You can use chaining input helper `grouped` after any `Input` type to capture it as an anonymous group.

## Debugging

When using `magic-regexp`, a TypeScript generic is generated for you that should show the RegExp that you are constructing, as you go.

This is true not just for the final RegExp, but also for the pieces you create along the way.

So, for example:

```ts
import { exactly } from 'magic-regexp'

exactly('test.mjs')
// (alias) exactly<"test.mjs">(input: "test.mjs"): Input<"test\\.mjs", never>

exactly('test.mjs').or('something.else')
// (property) Input<"test\\.mjs", never>.or: <"something.else">(input: "something.else") => Input<"(?:test\\.mjs|something\\.else)", never>
```

Each function, if you hover over it, shows what's going in, and what's coming out by way of regular expression

You can also call `.toString()` on any input to see the same information at runtime.
