title: Usage
---

```js
import { createRegExp, exactly } from 'magic-regexp'

const regExp = createRegExp(exactly('foo/test.js').after('bar/'))
console.log(regExp)

// /(?<=bar\/)foo\/test\.js/
```

## createRegExp

Every pattern you create with the library should be wrapped in `createRegExp`, which enables the build-time transform.

`createRegExp` accepts an arbitrary number of arguments of type `string` or `Input` (built up using helpers from `magic-regexp`), and an optional final argument of an array of flags or a flags string. It creates a `MagicRegExp`, which concatenates all the patterns from the arguments that were passed in.

```js
import { createRegExp, global, multiline, exactly } from 'magic-regexp'

createRegExp(exactly('foo').or('bar'))

createRegExp('string-to-match', [global, multiline])
// you can also pass flags directly as strings or Sets
createRegExp('string-to-match', ['g', 'm'])

// or pass in multiple `string` and `input patterns`,
// all inputs will be concatenated to one RegExp pattern
createRegExp(
  'foo',
  maybe('bar').groupedAs('g1'),
  'baz',
  [global, multiline]
) 
// equivalent to /foo(?<g1>(?:bar)?)baz/gm
```

::alert
By default, all helpers from `magic-regexp` assume that input that is passed should be escaped - so no special RegExp characters apply. So `createRegExp('foo?\d')` will not match `food3` but only `foo?\d` exactly.

## Creating inputs

There are a range of helpers that can be used to activate pattern matching, and they can be chained. Each one of these returns an object of type `Input` that can be passed directly to `new RegExp`, `createRegExp`, to another helper or chained to produce more complex patterns.

::alert
All helpers that takes `string` and `Input` are variadic functions, so you can pass in one or multiple arguments of `string` or `Input` to them and they will be concatenated to one pattern. for example, `exactly('foo', maybe('bar'))` is equivalent to `exactly('foo').and(maybe('bar'))`.
::

## Chaining inputs

All of the helpers above return an object of type `Input` that can be chained with the following helpers:

| `and`                                         | this takes a variable number of inputs and adds them as new pattern to the current input, or you can use `and.referenceTo(groupName)` to adds a new pattern referencing to a named group.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `or`                                          | this takes a variable number of inputs and provides as an alternative to the current input.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `after`, `before`, `notAfter` and `notBefore` | these takes a variable number of inputs and activate positive/negative lookahead/lookbehinds. Make sure to check [browser support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp#browser_compatibility) as not all browsers support lookbehinds (notably Safari).                                    |
| `times`                                       | this is a function you can call directly to repeat the previous pattern an exact number of times, or you can use `times.between(min, max)` to specify a range, `times.atLeast(x)` to indicate it must repeat at least x times, `times.atMost(x)` to indicate it must repeat at most x times or `times.any()` to indicate it can repeat any number of times, _including none_. |
| `optionally`                                  | this is a function you can call to mark the current input as optional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `groupedAs`                                   | this defines the entire input so far as a named capture group.

| `grouped`                                     | this defines the entire input so far as an anonymous group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `at`                                          | this allows you to match beginning/ends of lines with `at.lineStart()` and `at.lineEnd()`.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

::alert
By default, for better regex performance, creation input helpers such as `anyOf`, `maybe`, `oneOrMore`, and chaining input helpers such as `or`, `times(.between/atLeast/any)`, or `optionally` will wrap the input in a non-capturing group with `(?:)`. You can use chaining input helper `grouped` after any `Input` type to capture it as an anonymous group.

## Debugging

When using `magic-regexp`, a TypeScript generic is generated for you that should show the RegExp that you are constructing, as you go.

This is true not just for the final RegExp, but also for the pieces you create along the way.

So, for example:

```ts
import { exactly } from 'magic-regexp'

exactly('test.mjs')
// (alias) exactly<"test.mjs">(input: "test.mjs"): Input<"test\\.mjs", never>

exactly('test.mjs').or('something.else')
// (property) Input<"test\\.mjs", never>.or: <"something.else">(input: "something.else") => Input<"(?:test\\.mjs|something\\.else)", never>
```

Each function, if you hover over it, shows what's going in, and what's coming out by way of regular expression

You can also call `.toString()` on any input to see the same information at runtime.

## Type-Level match result (experimental)
We also provide an experimental feature that allows you to obtain the type-level results of a RegExp match or replace in string literals. To try this feature, please import all helpers from a subpath export `magic-regexp/further-magic` instead of `magic-regexp`.

```ts
import { createRegExp, exactly, digit } from 'magic-regexp/further-magic'
```

This feature is especially useful when you want to obtain the type of the matched groups or test if your RegExp matches and captures from a given string as expected.

This feature works best for matching literal strings such as
```ts
'foo'.match(createRegExp(exactly('foo').groupedAs('g1')))
```
which will return a matched result of type `['foo', 'foo']`. `result.groups` of type `{ g1: 'foo' }`, `result.index` of type `0` and `result.length` of type `2`.

If matching with dynamic string, such as 
```ts
myString.match(createRegExp(exactly('foo').or('bar').groupedAs('g1')))
```
the type of the matched result will be `null`, or array of union of possible matches `["bar", "bar"] | ["foo", "foo"]` and `result.groups` will be type `{ g1: "bar" } | { g1: "foo" }`.
